# DO NOT STEAL MY CODE! DO YOUR OWN WORK!

### Homework 1
Using the Xcode application build and run an Objective-C application that declares two integer values and then calculates the summation, subtraction, multiplication and division of the two integers and displays the results.  Be sure to declare variables for your summation, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations. Use comments to document your program to include the program name, the author, and creation date.

 

 Here is an example program output if the two integers had values of 10 and 5:

 The summation of 10 and 5 is 15.

 The subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5.

 The multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50.

 The division of 10 and 5 is 2.

  

  Demonstrate your code compiles and runs without issue (You can use screen captures to demonstrate this functionality in a word document). Name your Objective-C file Yournamehw1.m. Name your Word document Yournamehw1.doc (or Yournamehw1.docx)

  Homework 1 Submission requirements:
  Your completed assignment should consist of the Yournamehw1.m Objective-C file and a Yournamehw1.doc Word document. Submit each of these files to your LEO homework 1 assignment area no later than the due date listed in the syllabus.
